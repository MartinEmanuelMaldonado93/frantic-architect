# Frantic Architect Game
Frantic Architect is a simple game built using JavaScript, Cannon.js, and Three.js. In this game, you take on the role of an architect who must quickly place falling blocks to create a stable structure.

Game Objective
The objective of the game is to build a tower by placing blocks on top of each other. The blocks will fall from the sky, and you need to position them accurately to create a stable tower. As the game progresses, the blocks will fall faster, making it more challenging to build a stable structure.

Technologies Used
JavaScript: The programming language used to build the game logic.
Cannon.js: A physics engine that provides realistic physics simulation for the falling blocks.
Three.js: A 3D graphics library used to render the game environment.
Game Controls
Click the block !
Spacebar: Release the current block and let it fall.
Game Development Setup
To set up the game development environment, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or create a new project folder.
Set up a local development server or use a code editor with a live server extension.
Create an HTML file and include the necessary libraries (cannon.js, three.js) and your game JavaScript file.
In the JavaScript file, set up the game logic, including the game loop and event listeners for user input.
Use Three.js to create the game scene, including the camera, lights, and initial block.
Use Cannon.js to create the physics world and simulate the falling blocks.
Implement the game controls to move and rotate the blocks.
Create collision detection between the blocks and the tower.
Add scoring system and game over conditions.
Continuously spawn new blocks and increase the game difficulty as the player progresses.
Conclusion
Frantic Architect is a simple game that combines physics simulation with block stacking gameplay. By using Cannon.js for physics and Three.js for graphics, you can create an engaging gaming experience. Feel free to customize the game mechanics, add new features, or improve the visuals to make it your own!

Have fun building towering structures in the Frantic Architect game!
